# ML_learning_ECG_dataset
A General ML Learning classification task using supervised unsupervised and ensemble approach

### I performed:
- EDA on the dataset
- in total 5 supervised models
  - logistic regression
  - Decision tree
  - Linear SVC
  - SVM
  - k-nearest
- 1 unsupervised approach
  - k-means
- 3 ensembled methods
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning(later on realized which wasn't any use for this task)
### About the Dataset:
- It's from kaggle named as ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset. The dataset is combined of two databases named  the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. Both are resided in physionet.org
